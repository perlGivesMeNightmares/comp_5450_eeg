# The Goal

Use machine learning techniques to predict hand gestures through the use of EEG data. 

For Dr. Braun's COMP 5450 class

## Sources Used

[This paper](http://lup.lub.lu.se/luur/download?func=downloadFile&recordOId=8895013&fileOId=8895015) on EEG classification


## Running Locally

If you haven't already, install [python](https://www.python.org/downloads/), [pip](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/installing/), and [virtualenv](https://virtualenv.pypa.io/en/stable/) (optional)

CD into your project directory and run  ```pip install -r requirements.txt```
You can run ```pip freeze``` to confirm your packages were installed correctly

## Required Setup
For space reasons, much of the data is excluded. Add the additional data to the data folder.
You must also drop in an "images" directory with the relevant images.
